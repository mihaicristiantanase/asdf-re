# asdf-re
### _Mihai Cristian TÄƒnase_

Reconstruct an ASDF system from one Lisp file.

This solution can come in handy when working on a remote Lisp, meaning, the file generated by running asdf-re on a local ASDF system can be loaded and ran on the remote Lisp to recreate the ASDF system on the remote machine.
The same channel used for communicating with the remote Lisp is used for transfering the ASDF system. 

```lisp
;; install "asdf-re" by cloning to <quicklisp_dir>/local-projects
;; then, in a Lisp
(ql:quickload "asdf-re")
(asdf-re:reconstruct #p"/path/to/local/asdf/system/directory" #p"/path/to/remote/quicklisp/local-projects/")

;; the result is a lisp file located at "/tmp/<asdf-system-name>.lisp".
```
